# Peek::Git

Take a peek into the Git info of your Rails application.

Things this peek view provides:

- View the current branch name
- Compare the diff of the current revision on your GitHub repo

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'peek-git'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install peek-git

## Usage

Add the following to your `config/initializers/peek.rb`:

```ruby
Peek.into Peek::Views::Git
```

You will need to set the GitHub project's name with owner if you plan on
comparing the current ref against your default branch on GitHub.

```ruby
# nwo - name with owner - owner/name
Peek.into Peek::Views::Git, :nwo => 'dewski/json_builder'
```

You can also manually set each of the following optional options:

- SHA
- Default Branch (master by default)
- Branch Name
- Domain Name (github.com by default)
- Protocol (https by default)

```ruby
Peek.into Peek::Views::Git, \
  :sha => '740f6b7b11b8717efaf51ddb98ce23394544f7e0',
  :default_branch => 'rails4.0',
  :branch_name => 'integration',
  :domain => 'github.com',
  :protocol => 'https'
```

## Using Peek::Git on Heroku

Unfortunately Heroku [removes](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-compiler#compilation)
the .git directory during slug compilation which doesn't make it possible to
view the current deployed SHA or branch.

One workaround is to set the GIT_SHA and GIT_BRANCH ENV variables within
your deploy process.

An alternative workaround is to use the runtime dyno metadata lab flag:

    $ heroku labs:enable runtime-dyno-metadata -a <app name>

Then, Peek can display the current Heroku release and sha.
